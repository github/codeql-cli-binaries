GitHub CodeQL Terms and Conditions
==================================

These GitHub CodeQL Terms and Conditions ("**Terms**") are a legal
agreement between you (either as an individual or on behalf of an
entity) and GitHub, Inc. regarding your use of the GitHub CodeQL
software and associated documentation (collectively, the
"**Software**"). By using the Software, you accept these Terms. If you
do not accept these Terms, do not download, install, use, or copy the
Software.

Use Rights; Scope of License
----------------------------

The Software is licensed on a per user basis. You may use the Software
for any of the following:

  * To perform analysis on any codebase that is released under an Open
    Source Initiative (OSI)-approved open source software license;

  * To perform academic research on any codebase; and

  * To demonstrate the Software.

**These Terms do not authorize, and the Software cannot be used:**

  * **For any purpose not expressly set forth above (for example, you
    cannot use the Software on a code base that is released under a
    non-OSI-approved open source license, unless it is to perform
    academic research or to demonstrate the Software); or**

  * **To generate CodeQL databases for or during automated analysis,
    continuous integration or continuous delivery, whether as part
    of normal software engineering processes or otherwise.**

Further, except (and only to the extent) permitted by applicable law
or applicable third-party license, you will not (and have no right
to):

  * work around any technical limitations in the Software that only
    allow you to use it in certain ways;

  * reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Software;
  
  * remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of GitHub or its
    suppliers in the Software;
  
  * use the Software in any way that is against the law; or
  
  * share, publish, distribute or lend the Software, provide or make
    available the Software as a hosted solution (whether on a
    standalone basis or combined, incorporated or integrated with
    other software or services) for others to use, or transfer the
    Software or these Terms to any third party.

The Software is licensed, not sold. GitHub reserves all rights not
expressly granted in these Terms.

Open Source Software
--------------------

The Software may include components licensed under open source
software licenses. Any such licenses are included in the "Open Source
Notices" documentation that is included with the Software. Such
documentation also includes copies of all applicable open source
licenses.

To the extent the terms of the licenses applicable to open source
components require GitHub to make an offer to provide source code in
connection with the Software, such offer is hereby made, and you may
exercise it by contacting GitHub: https://github.com/contact.

Unless otherwise agreed to in writing with GitHub, your agreement with
GitHub will always include, at a minimum, these Terms. Open source
software licenses for the Software's source code constitute separate
written agreements. To the limited extent that any open source
software license expressly supersedes these Terms, such open source
license governs your use of the applicable component(s) of the
Software subject to such license.

GitHub Trademarks
-----------------

These Terms do not grant any right or license to use any of GitHub's
trademarks or logos, including, without limitation, the names GitHub
and CodeQL and any Software logo designs in the "logos" folder of the
Software. You agree not to display or use any of these trademarks or
logos in any manner without GitHub's prior written permission, except
as allowed by GitHub's Logos and Usage Policy located at
https://github.com/logos. GitHub reserves all right, title and
interest in and to all GitHub trademarks and logos.

Additional Services
-------------------

Auto-Updates: The Software may include an auto-update service. If the
Software automatically enables such service (or, if it is not
automatically enabled and you choose to use it), GitHub will
automatically update the Software when a new version is available.

Support
-------

Because the Software is "as-is," GitHub may not provide support for it.

Export Control
--------------

Customer will comply with all applicable export and import laws and
regulations that apply to the Software.
